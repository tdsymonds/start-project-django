{"name":"Start-project-django","tagline":"A python script to configure a Debian/Ubuntu machine ready for a new Django project.","body":"# **start-project-django**\r\n\r\nWhen I first started out learning the Django framework, I remember finding it really challenging to setup a server to host a Django project, so I've made this script to try and help people overcome this initial hurdle, so they can move straight on to the fun part, building an application. \r\n\r\nIf you do have experience then not to worry, this script should hopefully make configuring the server very quick and easy!\r\n\r\nThis is my preferred setup, using an Nginx, Gunicorn & Django stack using Supervisor and with a MySQL DB.\r\n\r\n**This script is designed to run on a clean server, do not run on a server with existing projects, or you may lose files or get unexpected results!**\r\n\r\nI've tested this script on both Debian and Ubuntu machines.\r\n\r\n\r\n## **Quick Start**\r\n\r\nLogin as root on your clean install of an Ubuntu or Debian machine.\r\n\r\nUpload the start-project-django.py file via ftp (or create a new file and copy and paste the content over).\r\n\r\nAmend the configuration section of the python file to your settings (if you're unsure about the os_requirements and requirements then leave what I have entered for the default):\r\n\r\n    username = 'username'           # The system user that will be created\r\n\r\n    db_name = 'mydb'                # The database name for our project\r\n    db_user = 'dbuser'              # The database user for our project\r\n    db_password = 'pass'            # The password for our database user\r\n\r\n    virtualenv_name = 'venv'        # The name of the virtual environment directory\r\n    repo_name = 'project'           # The name of the repo directory\r\n    project_name = 'my_project'     # The name of our project\r\n\r\n    domain_name = 'example.com'     # Your domain name or ip address\r\n\r\n    os_requirements = [             # Any os requirements can be added and removed\r\n        'python-virtualenv',        # from the list.\r\n        'libpq-dev',\r\n        'python-dev',\r\n        'nginx',\r\n        'supervisor',\r\n        'libmysqlclient-dev', \r\n        'python-mysqldb',\r\n        'build-essential',\r\n        'libjpeg-dev',\r\n        'mysql-server',\r\n    ]\r\n\r\n    requirements = [                # Any requirements can be added and removed\r\n        'gunicorn==19.4.1',         # from the list.\r\n        'mysql-python==1.2.5',\r\n        'Django==1.9.0',\r\n        'Pillow==3.0.0',\r\n    ]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRun the command:\r\n\r\n    python start-project-django.py\r\n\r\nThe script will now run and create your project. \r\n\r\nNOTE: You will be prompted for passwords at a couple of points, so follow the instructions given when prompted.\r\n\r\nOnce the script has complete, if you navigate to your domain or ip you will see the Django start page.\r\n\r\nThen follow the final instuctions to run the database migration to create Django's default tables in the database.\r\n\r\nGood luck!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## **Useful links**\r\n\r\nSome links that you may find useful:\r\n\r\n<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/intro/tutorial01/>\r\n\r\n<https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-manage-supervisor-on-ubuntu-and-debian-vps>\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-71630086-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
